# **1. Installation**
The code in the Jupyter Notebook is written in Python3.

The following libraries were used:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib.pyplot.

# **2. Project Motivation**
This project is part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program from Udacity. I was interested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand JobSatisfaction in the IT-Sector.

The following questions will be answered:
1) What about the JobSatisfaction by Gender?
2) Does Salary have an influence on JobSatisfation?
3) Does HoursPerWeek have an impact on JobSaticfation?

# **3. File Descriptions**
There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

# **4. Results**
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@DS_DataScience/high-job-satisfaction-in-it-sector-40f1002bb072).

# **5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements**
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
